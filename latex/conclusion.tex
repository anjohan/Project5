\section{Conclusion}
We have now seen how we can numerically solve the diffusion equations over a one-dimensional and two-dimensional space. For the one-dimensional solver, we saw that it is necessary to restrict our choice of step length in time- and space if we have to use the Forward Euler method to get decent results.  However, the restriction on step length does not apply to Backward Euler and the Crank-Nicolson scheme. We have also seen that the Crank-Nicolson gives us the most accurate results among the other two chosen methods. 

For the two-dimensional solver we used the same idea as for the Forward Euler, giving us results which did not diverge too much from an analytical solution.
