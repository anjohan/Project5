\section{Introduction}
Partial differential equations is a subject of many fields. These equations can describe the behavior of many natural phenomenas such as waves of sound or sea, the flow of a liquid, growth of a population or diffusion of different processes.

These equations are often solved numerically since an analytical solution is difficult, or perhaps impossible to find. An example is the Navier-Stokes equation to model the flow of a viscous flow when not certain assumptions to simplify the equations has been made.

In this report we will focus on how we can numerically solve the diffusion equation, which is given by
\begin{equation}\label{eq:diffusion}
\begin{aligned}
\pdv[2]{u(x,t)}{x} &= \pdv{u(x,t)}{t} &\: t>0, \:\:x\in[0,L] \\
u(x,0) &= 0  &0 < x < L\\
u(0,t) &= 0 &t>0 \\
u(L,t) &= 1&t>0
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
with \(L = 1\).
