\subsection{Analytical solution of the diffusion equation}
For the two dimensional case we will not consider a general solution to \vref{eq:twoDim}. However, we will consider a specific problem of our choice such that we can compare our two dimensional solver with the solution, ensuring us that the solver gives us sufficient accurate results.
\subsubsection{An analytical solution}
So, consider \vref{eq:twoDim} with the following boundaries over a spatial domain of size \(L \times L\):
\begin{equation} \label{eq:twoDimBoundaries}
\begin{aligned}
u(0,y,t) &= u(L,y,t) = 0, \quad &y \in (0,L),\quad t > 0 \\
u(x,0,t) &= u(x,L,t) = 0, \quad &x \in (0,L),\quad t > 0 \\
u(x,y,0) &= \sin(\frac{\pi}{L}x)\sin(\frac{\pi}{L}y), \quad&\text{for }x,y\in (0,L)
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
The chosen boundaries has no physical interpretation, but is made such that it can be easy for us to get an analytical solution to compare with our solver.

The procedure is similar as for the one dimensional case. Since the procedure of finding a solution is very similar as what we did in \vref{sec:analyticalOneDim}, we have included the calculation in \ref{twodimappendix} instead.

The analytical solution of \vref{eq:twoDim} with the boundaries \vref{eq:twoDimBoundaries} derived in Appendix A is
\begin{equation} \label{eq:analyticalSolutionTwoDim}
u(x,y,t) = \sin(\frac{\pi}{L}x)\sin(\frac{\pi}{L}y)e^{\frac{-2\pi^2}{L^2}t}
\end{equation}
