\section{Results in one dimension}
\subsection{Testing for different \(\boldsymbol{\Delta x}\)}
As derived in \ref{forwardstability}, the Forward Euler scheme requires that \(\Delta t \leq \tfrac{1}{2}\qty(\Delta x)^2\). Simulations with \(\Delta x = 1/10\) and \(\Delta x = 1/100\) and \(\Delta t = \tfrac{1}{2}\qty(\Delta x)^2\) gives the figure below.
\begin{figure}[H]

\input{deltaxtest.plt}
\caption{Results for two different values of \(\Delta x\). Generated by \program{deltaxtest.sh}.}
\end{figure}
It is clear from the figure that all methods give acceptable results for the tested values of \(\Delta x\). As expected from the error terms, the Crank Nicolson scheme slightly outperforms the others. For \(\Delta x=1/100\), there is essentially no difference. We see that the steady state requirement of linearity from \ref{steadystate} is fulfilled.
