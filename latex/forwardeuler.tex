\subsection{Forward Euler}
Forward Euler is the simplest and most intuitive algorithm implemented in this report. As we will see later, this simplicity in both idea and implementation comes at a cost, as the Forward Euler scheme is the only algorithm which sets requirements for the values of \(\Delta x\) and \(\Delta t\) to even give a reasonable solution.


\subsubsection{Derivation and error analysis}\label{sec:ForwardEulerDerivation}
The Forward Euler scheme is an explicit scheme based on Taylor polynomials. To find an approximation to the time derivative of \(u\) at point \((x_i,t_j)\), a first order Taylor polynomial around \(x_i,t_j\) is used to calculate \(u(x_i,t_{j+1})\):
\[
    u_{i,j+1} = u_{i,j} + h\pdv{u_{i,j}}{t} + \frac{1}{2}\qty(\Delta t)^2\pdv[2]{u(x_i,\tilde{t})}{t}
    \implies \pdv{u_{i,j}}{t} = \frac{u_{i,j+1}-u_{i,j}}{\Delta t} + \frac{1}{2}\Delta t\pdv[2]{u(x_i,\tilde{t})}{t}\eqtag{asymmnewton}
\]
where \(\tilde{t}\in(t_j,t_{j+1})\) and the last term is the truncation error, which is proportional to \(\Delta t\).

Similarly, the three point approximation to the second derivative (derived in \autocite{oblig1}) with its error is used to approximate the second derivative of \(u\) at point \((x_i,t_j)\) with respect to position:
\[
    \pdv[2]{u_{i,j}}{x} = \frac{u_{i+1,j} + u_{i-1,j} - 2u_{i,j}}{\qty(\Delta x)^2} - \frac{1}{12}\qty(\Delta x)^2\pdv[4]{u(\tilde{x},t_j)}{x}\eqtag{andrederivert}
\]
where the last term is the truncation error, which for this approximation is proportional to \(\qty(\Delta x)^2\). As shown in \autocite{oblig1}, the error term actually consists of two terms, one with \(\tilde{x}_1\in\qty(x_{i-1},x_i)\) and one with \(\tilde{x}_2\in\qty(x_i,x_{i+1})\), but this can be approximated with \(\tilde{x}\in(x_{i-1},x_{i+1})\).

Inserting these two expressions into the diffusion equation gives
\[
    \frac{u_{i,j+1}-u_{i,j}}{\Delta t} + \frac{1}{2}\Delta t\pdv[2]{u(x_i,\tilde{t})}{t}
    = \frac{u_{i+1,j} + u_{i-1,j} - 2u_{i,j}}{\qty(\Delta x)^2} - \frac{1}{12}\qty(\Delta x)^2\pdv[4]{u(\tilde{x},t_j)}{x}
\]
The goal is to find the value of \(u\) at the next time step, i.e. \(u_{i,j+1}\). Multiplying by \(\Delta t\) on both sides of the equation and moving one term to the right, we get
\begin{alignat*}{2}
    u_{i,j+1} &=&& u_{i,j} + \frac{\Delta t}{\qty(\Delta x)^2}\qty(u_{i+1,j} + u_{i-1,j}-2u_{i,j})\\
    &&&+ \frac{1}{2}\qty(\Delta t)^2\pdv[2]{u(x_i,\tilde{t})}{t} - \Delta t\cdot\frac{1}{12}\qty(\Delta x)^2\pdv[4]{u(\tilde{x},t_j)}{x}
    \intertext{The quantity \(\Delta t/\qty(\Delta x)^2\) can be defined as \(\alpha\), which, with a slight reorganisation yields the final expression}
    u_{i,j+1} &=&& \qty(1-2\alpha)u_{i,j} + \alpha\qty(u_{i+1,j}+u_{i-1,j})\\
    &&& +  \frac{1}{2}\qty(\Delta t)^2\pdv[2]{u(x_i,\tilde{t})}{t} - \Delta t\cdot\frac{1}{12}\qty(\Delta x)^2\pdv[4]{u(\tilde{x},t_j)}{x}
\end{alignat*}
The two error terms are proportional to \(\qty(\Delta t)^2\) and \(\Delta t\cdot \qty(\Delta x)^2\). As per usual, the global error is one order lower, as the error is accumulated. This gives one error term proportional to \(\Delta t\) and one proportional to \(\qty(\Delta x)^2\). The order of \(\qty(\Delta x)\) is not reduced, as this error is not accumulated. If we truncate the errors in \(u_{i,j}\) , we get the numerical approximation of \(u(x_i,t_{j+1})\) to be
\begin{equation}\label{eq:forwardEuler}
u_{i,j+1} = \qty(1-2\alpha)u_{i,j} + \alpha\qty(u_{i+1,j}+u_{i-1,j})
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Stability analysis of Forward Euler}\label{forwardstability}

To approximate the time derivative of Forward Euler, we get the ratios in \ref{eq:discreteRatios} to be
\begin{alignat*}{2}
    \qty(D_tG_k(t))_j &= -G_k(t_j)\mu_k \\
    \frac{G_k(t_{j+1}) - G_k(t_j) }{\Delta t} &= -G_k(t_j)\mu_k \\
    G_k(t_{j+1}) &= -\Delta t G_k(t_j)\mu_k + G_k(t_j) \\
    \frac{G_k(t_{j+1}) }{G_k(t_j)} &= 1-\Delta t \mu_k
\intertext{As discussed in \ref{sec:ideaNeumann}, we must have that}
    \abs{\frac{G_k(t_{j+1}) }{G_k(t_j)}} &\leq 1 \\
    \abs{1-\Delta t \mu_k} &\leq 1\\
    \abs{\Delta t \mu_k} &\leq 2\\
    \abs{\frac{4 \Delta t \sin^2\qty(\frac{k\pi \Delta x}{2})}{\Delta x^2} } &\leq 2 \\
    \abs{\frac{\Delta t \sin^2\qty(\frac{k\pi \Delta x}{2})}{\Delta x^2} } &\leq \frac{1}{2}
\intertext{Since \(\sin^2\qty(\frac{k\pi \Delta x}{2}) \leq 1\) for any \(k\) and \(\Delta x\), this simplifies to}
    \frac{\Delta t}{\Delta x^2} &\leq \frac{1}{2}\eqtag{eq:stabilityForwardEuler}
\end{alignat*}
which is the final criterion for stable results from the Forward Euler scheme.
